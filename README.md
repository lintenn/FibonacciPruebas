# PruebasFibonacci for the subject Mantenimiento y Pruebas del Software 2022
Repository with the aim to test with JUnit 5 an iterative version of computed Fibonacci sequence numbers given valid positions.
### This repository provides:
- Class "Fibonacci.java", which contains a method to compute the Fibonacci sequence number in a valid position. Negative positions are invalid. 
- Class "FibonacciTest.java", which contains JUnit 5 test cases to test the functionality of the "compute" method in "Fibonacci.java".
### Test cases:
- Should compute return zero if the position is zero.
- Should compute return one if the position is one.
- Should compute return one if the position is two.
- Should compute return two if the position is three.
- Should compute return three if the position is four.
- Should compute return fifty-five if the position is ten.
- Should compute of a negative number raise an exception.
